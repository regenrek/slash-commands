<plan>
$PLAN
</plan>

review the current <plan />

- reflects the current codebase (files, patterns, constraints)
- no fallbacks, no feature flags
- full change or full refactor only; no "future use" leftovers
- list code smells and caveats
- clear scope and out of scope
- performance, security, and privacy impact
- decision: if the analysis indicates >90% satisfaction with the implementation, mark GREEN LIGHT
